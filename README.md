AJ's Portfolio!

**Setup:**

**Clone**

git clone repo

**Django**

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

(Maybe) pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers

cd backend

python3 manage.py runserver

**React**

cd frontend
npm start

**_DONE!_**

Sectons that will either be links or very small demos of projects

currently set to be demos, but would prefer links,

Good Idea:

Section gives base idea of project with title and photo, and then a link to the actual demo

Demos so far:

  Ana table, make it look nothing like ST

  Air Scenario Builder
