## **Other Info**
Sectons that will either be links or very small demos of projects

currently set to be demos, but would prefer links,

Good Idea:

Section gives base idea of project with title and photo, and then a link to the actual demo

maybe add leetcode acc

Demos so far:

  Ana table, make it look nothing like ST

  Air Scenario Builder
